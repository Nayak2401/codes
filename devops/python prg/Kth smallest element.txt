Given an array arr[] and an integer K where K is smaller than size of array, the task is to find the Kth smallest element in the given array. It is given that all array elements are distinct.

Note :-  l and r denotes the starting and ending index of the array.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 6
arr[] = 7 10 4 3 20 15
K = 3
L=0 R=5

Output : 7
Explanation :
3rd smallest element in the given 
array is 7.


program


def smallest_k_value(arr,k):
    arr.sort()
    return arr[k-1]
arr=[7,10,4,3,20,15]
k=3
result=smallest_k_value(arr,k)
print("the kth value is",result)
