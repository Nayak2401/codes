
* Given a sorted array arr containing n elements with possibly some duplicate, the task is to find the first and last occurrences of an element x in the given array.
Note: If the number x is not found in the array then return both the indices as -1

Example 1:

Input:
n=9, x=5
arr[] = { 1, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 67, 123, 125 }
Output:  
2 5
Explanation: 
First occurrence of 5 is at index 2 and last occurrence of 5 is at index 5. 




def searchnum(num, targets):
    first = -1
    last = -1
    for i in range(len(num)):
        if  num[i] == targets:
            if first == -1:
                first=i
            last=i
    return [first, last]
num=[1,2,33,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,4,5,2,8,9]
targets = 4
result = searchnum(num, targets)
print(f"first & last position {targets} : {result}")
