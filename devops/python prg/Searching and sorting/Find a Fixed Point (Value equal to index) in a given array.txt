Given an array Arr of N positive integers. Your task is to find the elements whose value is equal to that of its index value ( Consider 1-based indexing ).

Note: There can be more than one element in the array which have the same value as its index. You need to include every such element's index. Follows 1-based indexing of the array.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
Arr[] = {15, 2, 45, 12, 7}
Output: 2
Explanation: Only Arr[2] = 2 exists here.

def findthearrayindex(arr):
    result = []
    for i in  range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i]== i+1:
            result.append(i+1)
    return result
arr=[33,2,5,44,22]
result_index=findthearrayindex(arr)
print(result_index)
